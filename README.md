Developed a hybrid model combining the strengths of different algorithms for robust crop price forecasting:

1. LSTM for Long-Term Trends
Captures seasonal patterns and multi-year price trends in agricultural commodities.

2. XGBoost for Short-Term Factors
Handles sudden price fluctuations using external features like weather, demand data, and government policies.

3. ARIMA for Statistical Baseline
Provides a stable forecasting foundation by capturing recent trends and smoothing fluctuations.

- Analyzed 10+ years of agricultural data from government sources
- Implemented hybrid model combining LSTM, XGBoost and ARIMA
- Achieved 92% accuracy in price predictions (7% improvement over single models)
- Integrated external factors like weather patterns and market trends
